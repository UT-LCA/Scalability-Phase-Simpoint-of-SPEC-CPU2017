# Scalability, Phase, Simpoint of SPEC CPU2017

This is the public repository of the results achieved from analysis on SPEC CPU2017 benchmark.

It is mainly consist of three parts:
1. Scalability of multi-threaded SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks is in the subfolder [Scalability](https://github.com/UT-LCA/Scalability-Phase-Simpoint-of-SPEC-CPU2017/tree/master/Scalability);
2. Phase-level behavior analysis result of SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks is in the subfolder [Phase](https://github.com/UT-LCA/Scalability-Phase-Simpoint-of-SPEC-CPU2017/tree/master/Phase);
3. SimPoints of SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks is in the subfolder [SimPoints](https://github.com/UT-LCA/Scalability-Phase-Simpoint-of-SPEC-CPU2017/tree/master/SimPoints);
Pinballs for SimPoints are available for download at [release](https://github.com/UT-LCA/Scalability-Phase-Simpoint-of-SPEC-CPU2017/releases).
