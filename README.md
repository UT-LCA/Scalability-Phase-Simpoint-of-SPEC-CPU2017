# Scalability, Phase, Simpoint of SPEC CPU2017

This is the public repository of the results achieved from analysis on SPEC CPU2017 benchmark.

Pinballs for SimPoints are available for download at [release](https://github.com/UT-LCA/Scalability-Phase-Simpoint-of-SPEC-CPU2017/releases).
- **Note:** Please refer to the [SPEC Fair Use Rules](http://www.spec.org/fairuse.html) before using these checkpoints. If used as the basis for prediction of SPEC run time or a SPEC metric, any results published must be very clearly tagged as “Estimated” or “Estimated by simulation of pinballs for representative simulation regions (PinPoints)”.
- **Note:** The "Source code (zip)" and the "Source code (tar.gz)" are packages of the repository, only have documentation. For a copy of SPEC CPU2017, please see [http://www.spec.org](http://www.spec.org/).
